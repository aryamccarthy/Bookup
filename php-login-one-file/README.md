## Live-demo

Live demo **[here](http://php-login.net/demo1.html)**, live demo's phpinfo() **[here](http://phpinfo.php-login.net/)**

## Requirements

- PHP 5.3.7+ (with PDO and SQLite extension activated)

## Installation (quick setup)

Run the install script `_install.php` in the `_installation` folder which will create a `users.db` file (the database).
That's it.

## Installation (very detailed setup)

A very detailed guideline [here in this blog post](http://www.dev-metal.com/how-to-install-php-login-nets-0-one-file-login-script-on-ubuntu/).

## Important security note

In the default setup the database - which is only a simple users.db file - can be downloaded directly.
To prevent this, change the path of your database file! A path that is not accessable by public is perfect.
The .htaccess in the project only works if you have set `AllowOverride` to `All` in your vhost / apache config.

## Short guide

The `index.php` does all the action, please look into the code for more info, everything is commented. The install script
`_install.php` creates a database (a file named `users.db`) right into the root folder. The `.htaccess` protects your
database file from being downloaded. The `password_compatibility_library.php` is only loaded automatically when you
use a PHP version older than 5.5 to add the new PHP 5.5 password hashing functions to these older PHP versions.
The `_debug.php` is a little helper tool, it simply echoes out the content of the database.
