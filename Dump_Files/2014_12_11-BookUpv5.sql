Through truly Shakespearean portraits of its victims -- men, women, and children -- we encounter secret police operations, labor camps and prisons; the uprooting or extermination of whole populations, the \"welcome\" that awaited Russian soldiers who had been German prisoners of war. Yet we also witness the astounding moral courage of the incorruptible, who, defenseless, endured great brutality and degradation. The Gulag Archipelago 1918-1956 -- a grisly indictment of a regime, fashioned here into a veritable literary miracle -- has now been updated with a new introduction that includes the fall of the Soviet Union and Solzhenitsyn\'s move back to Russia.','http://bks2.books.google.com/books?id=MqatfM14140C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api','http://bks2.books.google.com/books?id=MqatfM14140C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'),('9780060012342','en','The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents','Terry Pratchett','Winner of the 2001 Carnegie Medal One rat, popping up here and there, squeaking loudly, and taking a bath in the cream, could be a plague all by himself. After a few days of this, it was amazing how glad people were to see the kid with his magical rat pipe. And they were amazing when the rats followed hint out of town. They\'d have been really amazed if they\'d ever found out that the rats and the piper met up with a cat somewhere outside of town and solemnly counted out the money. The Amazing Maurice runs the perfect Pied Piper scam. This streetwise alley cat knows the value of cold, hard cash and can talk his way into and out of anything. But when Maurice and his cohorts decide to con the town of Bad Blinitz, it will take more than fast talking to survive the danger that awaits. For this is a town where food is scarce and rats are hated, where cellars are lined with deadly traps, and where a terrifying evil lurks beneath the hunger-stricken streets.... Set in Terry Pratchett\'s widely popular Discworld, this masterfully crafted, gripping read is both compelling and funny. When one of the world\'s most acclaimed fantasy writers turns a classic fairy tale on its head, no one will ever look at the Pied Piper -- or rats -- the same way again!','http://bks9.books.google.com/books?id=1Z8KJQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api','http://bks9.books.google.com/books?id=1Z8KJQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'),('9780060084608','en','Cheaper by the Dozen','Ernestine Gilbreth Carey','What do you get when you put twelve lively kids together with a father -- a famous efficiency expert -- who believes families can run like factories, and a mother who is his partner in everything except discipline?

In 1942, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse - mathematical genius and young Captain in the U.S. Navy - is assigned to detachment 2702. It is an outfit so secret that only a handful of people know it exists, and some of those people have names like Churchill and Roosevelt. The mission of Watrehouse and Detatchment 2702-commanded by Marine Raider Bobby Shaftoe-is to keep the Nazis ignorant of the fact that Allied Intelligence has cracked the enemy\'s fabled Enigma code. It is a game, a cryptographic chess match between Waterhouse and his German counterpart, translated into action by the gung-ho Shaftoe and his forces. Fast-forward to the present, where Waterhouse\'s crypto-hacker grandson, Randy, is attempting to create a \"data haven\" in Southeast Asia - a place where encrypted data can be stored and exchanged free of repression and scrutiny. As governments and multinationals attack the endeavor, Randy joins forces with Shaftoe\'s tough-as-nails grandaughter, Amy, to secretly salvage a sunken Nazi sumarine that holds the key to keeping the dream of a data haven afloat. But soon their scheme brings to light a massive conspiracy with its roots in Detachment 2702 linked to an unbreakable Nazi code called Arethusa. And it will represent the path to unimaginable riches and a future of personal and digital liberty...or to universal totalitarianism reborn. A breathtaking tour de force, and Neal Stephenson\'s most accomplished and affecting work to date, CRYPTONOMICON is profound and prophetic, hypnotic and hyper-driven, as it leaps forward and back between World War II and the World Wide Web, hinting all the while at a dark day-after-tomorrow.

But Charlie\'s been lucky. He owns a building in the heart of San Francisco, and runs a secondhand store with the help of a couple of loyal, if marginally insane, employees. He\'s married to a bright and pretty woman who actually loves him for his normalcy. And she, Rachel, is about to have their first child. Yes, Charlie\'s doing okay for a Beta. That is, until the day his daughter, Sophie, is born. Just as Charlie -- exhausted from the birth -- turns to go home, he sees a strange man in mint-green golf wear at Rachel\'s hospital bedside, a man who claims that no one should be able to see him. But see him Charlie does, and from here on out, things get really weird. . . . People start dropping dead around him, giant ravens perch on his building, and it seems that everywhere he goes, a dark presence whispers to him from under the streets. Strange names start appearing on his nightstand notepad, and before he knows it, those people end up dead, too.

In a nightmarish ruined world slowly awakening to the light after sleeping in darkness, the infant rediscoveries of science are secretly nourished by cloistered monks dedicated to the study and preservation of the relics and writings of the blessed Saint Isaac Leibowitz. From here the story spans centuries of ignorance, violence, and barbarism, viewing through a sharp, satirical eye the relentless progression of a human race damned by its inherent humanness to recelebrate its grand foibles and repeat its grievous mistakes.

From his home in Spain he journeys to the markets of Tangiers and across the Egyptian desert to a fateful encounter with the alchemist. The story of the treasures Santiago finds along the way teaches us, as only a few stories have done, about the essential wisdom of listening to our hearts, learning to read the omens strewn along life\'s path, and, above all, following our dreams.','http://bks8.books.google.com/books?id=pTr44Sx6oWQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','http://bks8.books.google.com/books?id=pTr44Sx6oWQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'),('9780061124266','en','Veronika Decides to Die','Paulo Coelho','Twenty-four-year-old Veronika seems to have everything -- youth and beauty, boyfriends and a loving family, a fulfilling job.

Winesburg, Ohio (1919) is Sherwood Anderson\'s masterpiece, a cycle of short stories concerning life in a small Ohio town at the end of the nineteenth century. At the centre is George Willard, a young reporter who becomes the confidant of the town\'s `grotesques\' - solitary figures unable to communicate with others. George is their conduit for expression and solace from loneliness, but he has his own longings which eventually draw him away from home to seek a career in the city. He carries with him the dreams and unuttered words of remarkable characters such as Wing Biddlebaum, the disgraced former teacher, and the story-telling Doctor Parcival. The book has influenced many American writers, including ernest hemingway, William Faulkner, John Updike, Raymond Carver, and Joyce Carol Oates.

Composed with the skills of a master, The Goldfinch is a haunted odyssey through present day America and a drama of enthralling force and acuity. It begins with a boy. Theo Decker, a thirteen-year-old New Yorker, miraculously survives an accident that kills his mother. Abandoned by his father, Theo is taken in by the family of a wealthy friend. Bewildered by his strange new home on Park Avenue, disturbed by schoolmates who don\'t know how to talk to him, and tormented above all by his unbearable longing for his mother, he clings to one thing that reminds him of her: a small, mysteriously captivating painting that ultimately draws Theo into the underworld of art. As an adult, Theo moves silkily between the drawing rooms of the rich and the dusty labyrinth of an antiques store where he works. He is alienated and in love-and at the center of a narrowing, ever more dangerous circle. The Goldfinch is a novel of shocking narrative energy and power. It combines unforgettably vivid characters, mesmerizing language, and breathtaking suspense, while plumbing with a philosopher\'s calm the deepest mysteries of love, identity, and art. It is a beautiful, stay-up-all-night and tell-all-your-friends triumph, an old-fashioned story of loss and obsession, survival and self-invention, and the ruthless machinations of fate.','http://bks1.books.google.com/books?id=LvUelwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api','http://bks1.books.google.com/books?id=LvUelwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'),('9780316056632','en','Soulless','Gail Carriger','Alexia Tarabotti is laboring under a great many social tribulations.

Their mission was to capture or kill a notorious al Qaeda leader known to be ensconced in a Taliban stronghold surrounded by a small but heavily armed force. Less then twenty-four hours later, only one of those Navy SEALs remained alive. This is the story of fire team leader Marcus Luttrell, the sole survivor of Operation Redwing, and the desperate battle in the mountains that led, ultimately, to the largest loss of life in Navy SEAL history. But it is also, more than anything, the story of his teammates, who fought ferociously beside him until he was the last one left-blasted unconscious by a rocket grenade, blown over a cliff, but still armed and still breathing. Over the next four days, badly injured and presumed dead, Luttrell fought off six al Qaeda assassins who were sent to finish him, then crawled for seven miles through the mountains before he was taken in by a Pashtun tribe, who risked everything to protect him from the encircling Taliban killers. A six-foot-five-inch Texan, Leading Petty Officer Luttrell takes us, blow-by-blow, through the brutal training of America\'s warrior elite and the relentless rites of passage required by the Navy SEALs. He transports us to a monstrous battle fought in the desolate peaks of Afghanistan, where the beleaguered American team plummeted headlong a thousand feet down a mountain as they fought back through flying shale and rocks.

With Love and Squalor, will not be surprised by the fact that his first novel is fully of children. The hero-narrator of THE CATCHER IN THE RYE is an ancient child of sixteen, a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield. Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children\'s voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden\'s voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart.

Their quest: to track down the obscure, vanished poet Cesárea Tinajero. A violent showdown in the Sonora desert turns search to flight; twenty years later Belano and Lima are still on the run. The explosive first long work by \"the most exciting writer to come from south of the Rio Grande in a long time\" (Ilan Stavans, Los Angeles Times), The Savage Detectives follows Belano and Lima through the eyes of the people whose paths they cross in Central America, Europe, Israel, and West Africa. This chorus includes the muses of visceral realism, the beautiful Font sisters; their father, an architect interned in a Mexico City asylum; a sensitive young follower of Octavio Paz; a foul-mouthed American graduate student; a French girl with a taste for the Marquis de Sade; the great-granddaughter of Leon Trotsky; a Chilean stowaway with a mystical gift for numbers; the anorexic heiress to a Mexican underwear empire; an Argentinian photojournalist in Angola; and assorted hangers-on, detractors, critics, lovers, employers, vagabonds, real-life literary figures, and random acquaintances. A polymathic descendant of Borges and Pynchon, Roberto Bolaño traces the hidden connection between literature and violence in a world where national boundaries are fluid and death lurks in the shadow of the avant-garde.

A terrifying evocation of a paranoid world where no one can be trusted. A surprising, unexpected story of love and family, of hope and resilience. CHILD 44 is a thriller unlike any you have ever read. \"There is no crime.\" Stalin\'s Soviet Union strives to be a paradise for its workers, providing for all of their needs. One of its fundamental pillars is that its citizens live free from the fear of ordinary crime and criminals. But in this society, millions do live in fear . . . of the State. Death is a whisper away. The mere suspicion of ideological disloyalty-owning a book from the decadent West, the wrong word at the wrong time-sends millions of innocents into the Gulags or to their executions. Defending the system from its citizens is the MGB, the State Security Force. And no MGB officer is more courageous, conscientious, or idealistic than Leo Demidov. A war hero with a beautiful wife, Leo lives in relative luxury in Moscow, even providing a decent apartment for his parents. His only ambition has been to serve his country. For this greater good, he has arrested and interrogated. Then the impossible happens. A different kind of criminal-a murderer-is on the loose, killing at will. At the same time, Leo finds himself demoted and denounced by his enemies, his world turned upside down, and every belief he\'s ever held shattered. The only way to save his life and the lives of his family is to uncover this criminal. But in a society that is officially paradise, it\'s a crime against the State to suggest that a murderer-much less a serial killer-is in their midst. Exiled from his home, with only his wife, Raisa, remaining at his side, Leo must confront the vast resources and reach of the MBG to find and stop a criminal that the State won\'t admit even exists.','http://bks5.books.google.com/books?id=XZqfnAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api','http://bks5.books.google.com/books?id=XZqfnAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'),('9780446545242','en','Angel','James Patterson','Max Ride and her best friends have always had one another\'s backs.

Their goal was simple: to blow up their school, Oklahoma-City style, and to leave \"a lasting impression on the world.\" Their bombs failed, but the ensuing shooting defined a new era of school violence-irrevocably branding every subsequent shooting \"another Columbine.\" When we think of Columbine, we think of the Trench Coat Mafia; we think of Cassie Bernall, the girl we thought professed her faith before she was shot; and we think of the boy pulling himself out of a school window -- the whole world was watching him. Now, in a riveting piece of journalism nearly ten years in the making, comes the story none of us knew. In this revelatory book, Dave Cullen has delivered a profile of teenage killers that goes to the heart of psychopathology. He lays bare the callous brutality of mastermind Eric Harris, and the quavering, suicidal Dylan Klebold, who went to prom three days earlier and obsessed about love in his journal. The result is an astonishing account of two good students with lots of friends, who came to stockpile a basement cache of weapons, to record their raging hatred, and to manipulate every adult who got in their way. They left signs everywhere, described by Cullen with a keen investigative eye and psychological acumen. Drawing on hundreds of interviews, thousands of pages of police files, FBI psychologists, and the boy\'s tapes and diaries, he gives the first complete account of the Columbine tragedy. In the tradition of HELTER SKELTER and IN COLD BLOOD, COLUMBINE is destined to be a classic. A close-up portrait of hatred, a community rendered helpless, and the police blunders and cover-ups, it is a compelling and utterly human portrait of two killers-an unforgettable cautionary tale for our times.','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=q1IOAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=q1IOAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'),('9780446579933','en','The Lucky One','Nicholas Sparks','In his 14th book, bestselling author Nicholas Sparks tells the unforgettable story of a man whose brushes with death lead him to the love of his life.

But just as his life seems to be settling into a blissful pattern, an unsettling and mysterious message re-opens old wounds and sets off a chain of events that will forever change the course of this young couple\'s marriage. Dramatic, heartbreaking and surprising, this is a story about the love between a man and a woman and between a parent and a child. More than that, it is a story that beautifully portrays how the same emotion that can break your heart is also the one that will ultimately heal it. While the novel picks up the tale of Lexie Darnell and Jeremy Marsh that started in True Believer and will delight fans of that novel, it stands on its own as one of Nicholas Sparks\'s most deeply moving love stories.','http://bks2.books.google.com/books?id=vwXhHAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api','http://bks2.books.google.com/books?id=vwXhHAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'),('9780446699488','en','Wish You Well','David Baldacci','Precocious 12-year-old Louisa Mae Cardinal lives in the hectic New York City of 1940 with her family.

His problem is Colonel Cathcart, who keeps raising the number of missions the men must fly to complete their service. Yet if Yossarian makes any attempts to excuse himself from the perilous missions that he is committed to flying, he is trapped by the Great Loyalty Oath Crusade, the hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule from which the book takes its title: a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes the necessary formal request to be relieved of such missions, the very act of making the request proves that he is sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved.

Much of Walden\'s material is derived from Thoreau\'s journals and contains such engaging pieces as \"Reading\" and \"The Pond in the Winter.\" Other famous sections involve Thoreau\'s visits with a Canadian woodcutter and with an Irish family, a trip to Concord, and a description of his bean field. This is the complete and authoritative text of Walden--as close to Thoreau\'s original intention as all available evidence allows. For the student and for the general reader, this is the ideal presentation of Thoreau\'s great document of social criticism and dissent.','http://bks8.books.google.com/books?id=-OiymAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api','http://bks8.books.google.com/books?id=-OiymAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'),('9780722536544','en','The Fifth Mountain','Paulo Coelho','Published in over 100 countries, translated into 42 different languages, with over 21 million copies of his books sold internationally, Paulo Coelho can truly claim to be one of the most popular writers in the world.','http://bks8.books.google.com/books?id=pECvngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api','http://bks8.books.google.com/books?id=pECvngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'),('9780738703916','en','Blue is for Nightmares','Laurie Faria Stolarz','Sixteen-year-old hereditary witch Stacey Brown has nightmares of her roommate being murdered and hopes that her magick will be enough to protect Drea--unlike the last person whose death Stacey dreamed.','http://bks2.books.google.com/books?id=KkVSGUl-vrYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api','http://bks2.books.google.com/books?id=KkVSGUl-vrYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'),('9780738710181','en','Leaving Paradise','Simone Elkeles','Feeling like outsiders since Caleb Becker\'s drunken car accident left Maggie Armstrong a cripple, Caleb and Maggie end up finding comfort and strength from a surprising source: each other.

Never satisfied with easy answers or soft platitudes, Mitch explores some of life\'s greatest mysteries and unanswered questions with great honesty, depth and self reflection. \" --Jim Wallis, CEO and Founder of Sojourners and author of The Great Awakening What if our beliefs were not what divided us, but what pulled us together In Have a Little Faith, Mitch Albom offers a beautifully written story of a remarkable eight-year journey between two worlds--two men, two faiths, two communities--that will inspire readers everywhere. Albom\'s first nonfiction book since Tuesdays with Morrie, Have a Little Faith begins with an unusual request: an eighty-two-year-old rabbi from Albom\'s old hometown asks him to deliver his eulogy. Feeling unworthy, Albom insists on understanding the man better, which throws him back into a world of faith he\'d left years ago. Meanwhile, closer to his current home, Albom becomes involved with a Detroit pastor--a reformed drug dealer and convict--who preaches to the poor and homeless in a decaying church with a hole in its roof. Moving between their worlds, Christian and Jewish, African-American and white, impoverished and well-to-do, Albom observes how these very different men employ faith similarly in fighting for survival: the older, suburban rabbi embracing it as death approaches; the younger, inner-city pastor relying on it to keep himself and his church afloat. As America struggles with hard times and people turn more to their beliefs, Albom and the two men of God explore issues that perplex modern man: how to endure when difficult things happen; what heaven is; intermarriage; forgiveness; doubting God; and the importance of faith in trying times. Although the texts, prayers, and histories are different, Albom begins to recognize a striking unity between the two worlds--and indeed, between beliefs everywhere. In the end, as the rabbi nears death and a harsh winter threatens the pastor\'s wobbly church, Albom sadly fulfills the rabbi\'s last request and writes the eulogy. And he finally understands what both men had been teaching all along: the profound comfort of believing in something bigger than yourself. Have a Little Faith is a book about a life\'s purpose; about losing belief and finding it again; about the divine spark inside us all. It is one man\'s journey, but it is everyone\'s story. Ten percent of the profits from this book will go to charity, including The Hole In The Roof Foundation, which helps refurbish places of worship that aid the homeless.','http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=hI8kAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api','http://bks3.books.google.com/books?id=hI8kAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'),('9780802130303','en','Ficciones','Jorge Luis Borges','Short narratives probe man\'s soul to reveal his conflicting emotions, motives, and desires and his tortured struggle for salvation','http://bks4.books.google.com/books?id=1FrJqcRILaoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','http://bks4.books.google.com/books?id=1FrJqcRILaoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'),('9780802133908','es','Pedro Páramo','Juan Rulfo','Deserted villages of rural Mexico, where images and memories of the past linger like unquiet ghosts, haunted the imaginations of the author.

We weren\'t wealthy, we weren\'t poor -- we just were. We never wanted for anything, except maybe more time together.... When Eddie was twelve years old, all he wanted for Christmas was a bike. Although his life had gotten harder -- and money tighter -- since his father died and the family bakery closed...Eddie dreamed that somehow his mother would find a way to have his dream bike gleaming beside their modest Christmas tree that magical morning. What he got from her instead was a sweater. \"A stupid, handmade, ugly sweater\" that young Eddie left in a crumpled ball in the corner of his room. Scarred deeply by the realization that kids don\'t always get what they want, and too young to understand that he already owned life\'s most valuable treasures, that Christmas morning was the beginning of Eddie\'s dark and painful journey on the road to manhood. It will take wrestling with himself, his faith, and his family -- and the guidance of a mysterious neighbor named Russell -- to help Eddie find his path through the storm clouds of life and finally see the real significance of that simple gift his mother had crafted by hand with love in her heart. Based on a deeply personal true story, The Christmas Sweater is a warm and poignant tale of family, faith and forgiveness that offers us a glimpse of our own lives -- while also making us question if we really know what\'s most important in them.','http://bks4.books.google.com/books?id=SMkQlAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api','http://bks4.books.google.com/books?id=SMkQlAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'),('9781416903376','en','Emperor Mage','Tamora Pierce','When she is sent as part of the delegation from Tortall to negotiate a peace treaty with Carthak, fifteen-year-old Daine must use her powers to communicate with animals for more than healing the Carthak emperor\'s dying birds.','http://bks0.books.google.com/books?id=umKSngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api','http://bks0.books.google.com/books?id=umKSngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'),('9781416914280','en','City of Bones','Cassandra Clare','Suddenly able to see demons and the Darkhunters who are dedicated to returning them to their own dimension, fifteen-year-old Clary Fray is drawn into this bizzare world when her mother disappears and Clary herself is almost killed by a monster.','http://bks8.books.google.com/books?id=N25JAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api','http://bks8.books.google.com/books?id=N25JAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'),('9781416950059','en','Identical','Ellen Hopkins','Do twins begin in the womb?

Everyone is doing their part -- Seph is monitoring the Weirwalls; Jack and Ellen are training their ghostly army; even Anaweir Will and Fitch are setting booby traps around the town\'s perimeter. But to Jason Haley, it seems like everyone wants to keep him out of the action. He may not be the most powerful wizard in Trinity, but he\'s prepared to fight for his friends. When Jason finds a powerful talisman --a huge opal called the Dragonheart--buried in a cave, his role takes on new importance. The stone seems to sing to Jason\'s very soul -- showing him that he is meant for more than anyone guessed. Trinity\'s guardians take the stone away after they realize that it may be a weapon powerful enough to save them all. Without any significant power of his own, and now without the stone, what can Jason possibly do to help the people he cares about -- and to prove his mettle? Madison Moss can feel the beating heart of the opal, too. The desire for it surges through her, drawing her to it. But Maddie has other things besides the Dragonheart on her mind. She has a secret. Ever since absorbing the magical blow that was meant to kill Seph, she\'s been leaking dark powers. Although Maddie herself is immune to magic, what would her friends think if they knew what kind of evil lay within her? Trinity\'s enemies are as enthusiastic about her powers as she is frightened. They think they can use her to get to the Dragonheart -- and they\'ll use anyone Maddie cares about to make her steal the stone for them. Moral compasses spin out of control as a final battle storms through what was once a sanctuary for the gifted. With so much to lose, what will Jason and Maddie be willing to fight for -- and what will they sacrifice?

Skinny Legs and All deals with today\'s most sensitive issues: race, politics, marriage, art, religion, money, and lust. It weaves lyrically through what some call the \"end days\" of our planet. Refusing to avert its gaze from the horrors of the apocalypse, it also refuses to let the alleged end of the world spoil its mood. And its mood is defiantly upbeat.
